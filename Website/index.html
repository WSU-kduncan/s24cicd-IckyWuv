                        <p class="meal-descript-about">In cuisine, an omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat, cheese, onions or some combination of the above. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                        <p><br>3 eggs, beaten
                            <br>1 tsp sunflower oil
                            <br>1 tsp butter
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.
                            2. Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn’t get too brown or overcooked.
                            3. Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.
                            4. Fill the omelette: Add the filling—but don’t overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds
                            5. Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>------ Marination ------

                            <br>1. Wash and pat dry the mutton pieces.
                            <br>2. In a large bowl, combine ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, biryani masala, yogurt, lemon juice, oil, and salt.
                            <br>3. Massage the marinade thoroughly into the mutton pieces.
                            <br>4. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or ideally overnight.
                            <br><br>------ Cooking the Rice ------
                            
                            <br>5. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil.
                            <br>6. Add cloves, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, and cardamom pods to the boiling water.
                            <br>7. Add the soaked basmati rice and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until 80% cooked.
                            <br>8. Drain the rice using a colander and set it aside.
                            <br><br>------ Searing the Mutton and Building the Sauce ------
                            
                            <br>9. Heat ghee or vegetable oil over medium heat in a separate pot or pressure cooker.
                            <br>10. Add the thinly sliced onions and saute until golden brown.
                            <br>11. Introduce the marinated mutton and cook for a few minutes, searing the meat on all sides.
                            <br>12. Add ½ cup of water and bring to a simmer.
                            <br>13. Cover the pot and cook on medium heat until the mutton is tender (30-45 minutes in a traditional pot, or 15-20 whistles in a pressure cooker).
                            <br><br>------ Assembling the Biryani ------
                            
                            <br>14. Select a heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid.
                            <br>15. Spread half of the cooked rice evenly across the bottom of the pot.
                            <br>16. Top the rice with half of the cooked mutton pieces.
                            <br>17. Add half of the caramelized onions over the mutton layer.
                            <br>18. Sprinkle generously with chopped mint and coriander leaves.
                            <br>19. Repeat steps 15-18 with the remaining rice, mutton, and onions.
                            <br>20. Drizzle the fragrant saffron milk (if using) over the top layer.
                            <br>21. Dot the surface with ghee or oil.
                            <br><br>------ Sealing and Cooking (Dum) ------
                            
                            <br>22. If your pot lid isn't tight, create a seal using a flour paste around the rim.
                            <br>23. Place the sealed pot on the lowest heat setting and cook for 15-20 minutes.
                            <br><br>------ Serving ------
                            
                            <br>24. Turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for an additional 10 minutes before serving.

                            <br>1. 225g (8 oz) plain flour, sifted
                            <br>2. 75g (2.6 oz) cornflour (corn starch), sifted
                            <br>3. Water – about 170ml
                            <br>4. A pinch of salt
                            <br><br>------ FOR THE FILLING ------
                            <br>1. 300g (11oz) lean ground chicken
                            <br>2. 5 cloves garlic, finely chopped
                            <br>3. 2.5cm (1 inch) piece of ginger, finely chopped
                            <br>4. 3 spring onions, finely chopped
                            <br>5. ½ onion, finely chopped
                            <br>6. 1 lemongrass stalk, white part only, thinly sliced and chopped
                            <br>7. 3 tbsp fresh coriander, finely chopped
                            <br>8. 2 green finger chillies, finely chopped
                            <br>9. 1 tsp ground cumin
                            <br>10. 2 tbsp light soy sauce
                            <br>11. Salt and pepper to taste
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Start by making your momo dough, if making. Sift the flours and salt into a large bowl.
                            <br>2. Slowly add the water while mixing until you have a firm but soft dough. If the dough is too wet, add more flour. Too dry, add a little more water. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it is, add a bit more flour.
                            <br>3. Cover the dough and place, covered in the refrigerator for at least 60 minutes or overnight. A minimum of one hour sitting time will be best.
                            <br>4. In a mixing bowl, mix the chicken with all the other filling ingredients together until well combined.
                            <br>5. When ready to make your beef momos, roll the dough into a long snake shape that is about 2.5cm (1 inch in diameter.
                            <br>6. Divide this dough into smaller pieces. For reference, I divide mine into 13 to 14g balls so that each of the momos are about the same size. You could just do this by eye though as shown in the photos above.
                            <br>7. Keep the small balls covered while you work to avoid drying. Take one of the balls and flatten it some with your fingers and then roll out into a circle shape that is about 2mm thick and 9cm in diameter. This is assuming you are using 13 - 14g pieces so the size of your momo wrappers may differ.
                            <br>8. Place a spoonful of the chicken mixture onto the wrapper and dampen around sides of the circle with water using your finger and fold it over into a half circle and the pinch one of the ends together.
                            <br>9. Now press the rest of the half circle together while pressing with your thumb to make a moon shape and sealing by pleating the seam.
                            <br>10. Cover and repeat with the rest of the dough. You may have some of the beef mixture left over but I'm sure you can find a use for it. Throw it into a pasta sauce for example.
                            <br>11. Place the beef momos in your steamer and steam for 5 to 6 minutes. The dough will become soft. You may need to do this in batches as it is important that the momos not touch each other while steaming or they will stick together.
                            <br>12. Eat immediately with soy sauce and/or chilli sauce.
                        </p>

                            <br>1. 2 pounds chicken wings
                            <br>2. 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

                            <br><br>------ Buffalo Hot Sauce ------
                            <br>1. ½ cup butter
                            <br>2. 1 clove garlic, minced
                            <br>3. ½ cup hot pepper sauce, or to taste
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Toss chicken wings in a large bowl with apple cider vinegar, garlic salt, paprika, red pepper flakes, onion salt, and black pepper to coat; cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours.
                            <br>2. Scatter flour over chicken wings; toss to coat. Discard any remaining marinade.
                            <br>3. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
                            <br>4. Heat shortening in a large skillet over medium-high heat; fry chicken in hot shortening until golden, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer fried chicken to a baking sheet.
                            <br>5. Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Remove chicken to a paper towel-lined platter to drain.
                            <br>6. Make sauce: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook garlic in melted butter until translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir hot sauce into butter-garlic mixture; reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Transfer sauce to a large bowl.
                            <br>7. Working in batches, add chicken to sauce in the bowl and turn to coat. Drizzle any remaining sauce over wings to serve.

                        <p><br>3 boneless chicken breasts (around half a kg)
                            <br>1 tspn of pepper
                            <br>1 tspn of salt

                            <br>2 tblspns of Flour
                            <br>1 Egg
                            <br>1 1/2 cups of Breadcrumbs
                            <br>Soft seeded burger buns
                            <br>Mayonnaise or KFC Zinger Sauce
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. If your chicken breasts are too big, slice them before cooking. Then, marinade the chicken breasts in the Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, mustard, or all-spice powder. Leave the chicken for at least four hours or over night.
                            <br>2. An egg and two tablespoons of water should be beaten together to make the batter, which should then be set aside.
                            <br>3. Chicken breasts that have been marinated should be heavily dusted in flour. They should be well coated after being dipped in both the egg and the breadcrumbs.
                            <br>4. The coated chicken breasts should be deep-fried in heated oil over a medium-high heat until they are crisp and golden brown.
                            <br>5. The finished burger should be stacked with the lettuce on top, followed by the chicken, and then the mayonnaise or KFC zinger sauce. The buns should be cut in half and lightly toasted. If you'd like a cheesy kick, add some sliced American cheese.

                            <br>2. kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper, to season
                            <br>3. 1 Tbsp unsalted butter
                            <br>4. 2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil

                            <br>10. 1 oz dried shitake mushrooms (or 1/2 cup fresh)
                            <br>11. 1–2 tsp sea salt, to taste
                            <br>12. 2 large eggs
                            <br>13. 1/2 cup scallions, sliced
                            <br>14. 2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles
                            <br>15. optional: fresh jalapeño or chili slices, for serving
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>------ COOK THE CHICKEN ------
                            <br>1. Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.
                            <br>2. Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
                            <br>3. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.
                            <br><br>------ MAKE THE RAMEN BROTH ------
                            <br>4. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.
                            <br>5. Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.
                            <br><br>------ MAKE THE SOFT-BOILED EGGS ------
                            <br>6. Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yolk).
                            <br>7. Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.
                            <br><br>------ THE RAMEN BOWLS ------
                            <br>8. Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.
                            <br>9. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with the fresh scallions, jalapeño, and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately. Enjoy!!

                            <br>1. 500ml plain yogurt
                            <br>2. 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
                            <br>3. 1 teaspoon chilli powder
                            <br>4. 1 teaspoon turmeric
                            <br>5. 1 tablespoon tomato paste
                            <br>6. A pinch of salt
                            <br>7. 1 teaspoon chopped coriander seeds
                            <br>8. 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
                            <br>9. 6 fenugreek seeds
                            <br>10. 10 curry leaves
                            <br>11. Corn flour (optional)
                            <br>12. 3 tablespoons finely chopped coriander
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Start by preparing the koftas. Grate the potatoes into a large bowl.
                            <br>2. Stir in the turmeric, salt, coriander seeds, fresh coriander, garam masala and two tablespoons of the flour to the potatoes.
                            <br>3. Start forming into koftas the size of ping-pong balls. If the mix is too sticky, add a little more flour.
                            <br>4. Now make the sauce. Pour the yogurt into a large bowl and add the chilli powder, turmeric, salt and tomato paste.
                            <br>5. Whisk until spooth.
                            <br>6. Heat the oil over medium high heat and toss in the whole and chopped spices followed by the curry leaves. Sizzle for about 20 seconds until fragrant and then carefully pour in the yogurt mixture. The yogurt may splatter a bit when it hits the oil.
                            <br>7. Stir it all up and simmer for about three minutes. Skim the excess oil off the top. If you would like a thicker sauce, add about a teaspoon of corn flour. I usually don’t bother.
                            <br>8. Now heat some oil for deep frying. Your oil is ready when a piece of the potato sizzles when it hits the oil. Fry your koftas until nicely browned and crunchy on the outside.
                            <br>9. Remove the fried koftas to a paper towel to absorb any excess oil.
                            <br>10. If serving as a curry, stir the kofta into the sauce or serve as an hors-d’oeuvre, placing each kofta on top of a spoonful of sauce.
                            <br>11. Check for seasoning and serve immediately.
